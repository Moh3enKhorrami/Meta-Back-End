Installing Python paths (Optional for Mac users)
If you want to work on your local device and have an Apple Mac computer you will need to install Python 3. By default, an Apple Mac has Python installed with version 2.7. You can verify this by opening up a terminal and running the following command: 

python --version  

For the lessons in this course, you will need Python 3. 

Before you can install Python you will need to install a few dependencies.  These are 'XCode' and' brew'.  You will find details of these in the "Required dependencies" reading. Mac has a few different ways to do installations but the most common way is to use the package manager called 'brew' to handle installations.

Once the dependencies are installed you can begin to install Python. Run the following command: 

brew install python  

When you install Python via brew it will install version 3.x. To verify that you have both versions installed run the following:

python --version  

python3 --version  

To reduce confusion you need to set the paths to point to the brew install of python3. First, let's figure out where it was installed by the package manager brew. Run the following command: 

brew info python  

The section you are interested in is the location of where it was installed. 

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to `python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into   /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin  

The /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.x/libexec/bin is the one you want to use and set for your path. Copy it from the terminal. Depending on the version of Mac OS you are running the next steps may vary slightly. 

Modifying the .zshrc or .bashrc file, depending on whether you are using Zsh or Bash as your shell, is necessary to ensure seamless access to Python throughout the system. By adding the Python executable's path to the system's PATH in the appropriate configuration file, users can run Python commands from any location in the terminal without specifying the full path to the Python interpreter each time. It also makes Python readily available for development, scripting, and various tasks without repetitive configuration.

Zsh
vim ~/.zshrc  


Bash 
vim ~/.bashrc  


Vim is a text editor and allows you to make changes to files directly from the shell. To make the edits:

1. Press the "I" key on your keyboard.
2.  Add the following line and remember to replace 3.x with the Python version that was installed on your system: 

export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.x/libexec/bin:$PATH" 

3. Press the esc key to exit from insert mode. 

4. Hold down the shift key and press the colon key represented by : & ; 

5. Type wq! and then hit Enter to exit vim. 

6. Run the following: 

For Zsh shell source ~/.zshrc 

For Bash shell source ~/.bashrc 

7. To verify everything is working as you would expect, run the following: 

shell python --version Python 3.9.10 

8. You should see the output similar to the above depending on your install version.
