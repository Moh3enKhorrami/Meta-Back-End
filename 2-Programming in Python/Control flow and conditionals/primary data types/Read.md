In Python, there are four primary data types: Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries. Each has distinct characteristics and use cases:

1. **List:**
   - **Features:**
     - Ordered.
     - Can contain elements of any data type (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, etc.).
     - Mutable; elements can be modified after creation.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     my_list = [1, 2, 'three', [4, 5]]
     ```

2. **Tuple:**
   - **Features:**
     - Ordered.
     - Similar to a list but immutable; elements cannot be changed after creation.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     my_tuple = (1, 2, 'three', (4, 5))
     ```

3. **Set:**
   - **Features:**
     - Unordered; elements do not have a specific order.
     - Each element is unique.
     - Mutable; elements can be modified after creation.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     my_set = {1, 2, 'three', 2}
     ```

4. **Dictionary:**
   - **Features:**
     - Consists of key-value pairs.
     - Ordered (from Python 3.7 onwards); key-value pairs maintain the order of insertion.
     - Mutable; key-value pairs can be modified after creation.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
     ```

Using these data types, you can effectively work with data in Python, leveraging their specific features for different scenarios.
